<h2>Projects<h2>
	<h3>Mossbauer Spectroscopy of Iron</h3>
Measured the intrinsic magnetic field inside iron crystals and associated nuclear quadrupole splitting. Programmed and used data analysis on Multichannel Analyzer to record the subtle chemical shifts due to the different electronic environments of the iron nuclei in the source and the absorber- Winter 2016
	<h3>Low Temperature Superconductivity</h3>
Recorded the transitions of Hg sample from normal to superconducting with varying vapor pressures- and thus the temperature of the surrounding liquid helium bath. Learned about the use and handling of cryogenic fluids and the operation of vacuum pumps and associated vacuum hardware while applying problem solving skill set- Winter 2016
	<h3>Surface Plasmon Resonance</h3>
Observed and recorded the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) curve for a thin metal film. Acquired a resonance curve and used analysis and fitting programs to work out dispersion relation for plasmon excitation process. Presented data for multiple wavelengths of laser light. Required great attention to detail- Winter 2016
